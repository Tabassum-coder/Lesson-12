        apple, (Malus domestica), domesticated tree and fruit of the rose family (Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated
        tree fruits. Apples are predominantly grown for sale as fresh fruit, though apples are also used commercially for
        vinegar, juice, jelly, applesauce, and apple butter and are canned as pie stock. A significant portion of the global
        crop also is used for cider, wine, and brandy. Fresh apples are eaten raw or cooked. There are a variety of ways in
        which cooked apples are used; frequently, they are used as a pastry filling, apple pie being perhaps the archetypal
        American dessert. Especially in Europe, fried apples characteristically accompany certain dishes of sausage or pork.
        Apples provide vitamins A and C, are high in carbohydrates, and are an excellent source of dietary fibre.

        Malus species are native to the temperate zones of both hemispheres. The cultivated apple is thought to have been
        domesticated from a wild apple, M. sieversii, in the Tien Shan mountains in Central Asia some 4,000–10,000 years ago.
        From there it spread to western Europe along the Silk Road and hybridized with a number of wild crabapples, including M.
        baccata from Siberia, M. orientalis from the Caucasus, and M. sylvestris, the major secondary genetic contributor, from
        other parts of Europe.

        Physical description
        
        apple flowersClose-up of apple blossoms (Malus domestica).
        Apple trees are generally small trees, and a given variety can be grafted onto dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks for
        smaller and less vigorous plants. If left untrimmed, a tree grown with standard (seedling) rootstock will often reach a
        height of 9 metres (30 feet) with an equally large crown diametre. The bark is usually brown and scaly. The simple
        leaves are roughly oval in shape and usually have fine teeth along the margins. Apple flowers are showy with five white
        petals, often tinged with pink, and numerous stamens. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and most
        varieties require cross-pollination for fertilization.

        The apple itself is a pome (fleshy) fruit, in which the ripened ovary and surrounding tissue both become fleshy and
        edible. When harvested, apples are usually roundish, 5–10 cm (2–4 inches) in diameter, and some shade of red, green, or
        yellow in colour; they vary in size, shape, and acidity depending on the variety, of which there are thousands. Apple
        varieties fall into three broad classes: (1) cider varieties, (2) cooking varieties, and (3) dessert varieties, which
        differ widely but tend to emphasize colour, size, aroma, smoothness, and perhaps crispness and tang. Many varieties are
        relatively high in sugar, only mildly acidic, and very low in tannin. In the United States, popular dessert varieties
        include the Honeycrisp, Red Delicious, Gala, Granny Smith, and Golden Delicious. Apple varieties that ripen during late
        summer are generally of poor quality for storage, while those that ripen in late autumn may be stored for as long as one
        year. For long holding, temperatures only slightly above the freezing point of the fruit are generally desirable. Apples
        may also be stored in inert gases or in controlled atmospheres.
